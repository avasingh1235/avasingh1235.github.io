        Quidditch is the most popular sport within the Wizarding World. Players ride on flying broomsticks and race to score the most points. Each house within Hogwarts has its own Quidditch team, with huge matches that the whole school attends.

    <h2 >How the Game Works</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> Each team has seven players in the air at a time. </li>
        <li><strong>Three</strong> of these players are Chasers, who try to score points by hitting the Quaffle through the opposing team's three hoops</li> 
        <li><strong>Two</strong> of the players are Beaters, who defend their teemates from Bludgers.</li>
        <li> The remaining player is the Seeker, who spends the whole game looking for Golden Snitch. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Famous Quidditch Terms</h2>

     <li><strong>Golden Snitch:</strong> A small, shiny, golden, winged ball that flutters about the stadium, that is worth 150 points and thus ends the game if caught by the winning team.
